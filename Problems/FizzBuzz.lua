Great! 

On 10/29 at 8am I will be on Skype: Aurametrix
I will let you know if more details come up.

Kort, Bernhard and Johanna will be calling from Germany
Kort mentioned that he was still investigating the long-term stability of the silver coating. It's probably possibly to modify the coating for different analytes, you could ask him about it. 

The main purpose of the call is to get to know each other better, for future collaborations. 

Phil Young might be joining us from Pine Grove, he worked on nanocomposites for chemical detection and optical systems at NASA.

Best,
Irene
